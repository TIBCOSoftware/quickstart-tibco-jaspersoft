## TIBCO JasperReports Server on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys TIBCO JasperReports Server, a reporting and analytics server, on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 35 minutes. Options include the deployment of a cluster or of a single instance.

This Quick Start is for developers, IT professionals, architects, and other technical users who plan to implement or extend their deployment of JasperReports Server to the AWS Cloud.

Using JasperReports Server, you can create, share, and manage reports, dashboards, and data visualizations.
